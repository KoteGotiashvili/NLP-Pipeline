## NLP Use Cases
![alt text](images/nlpusecases.png)

I will discuss few of them and add other use cases too:

**Text Classification:**  Sorting text into predefined categories
like spam detection in emails or sentiment analysis in customer 
reviews.

**Information Extraction/Gathering:** Identifying and extracting 
specific pieces of information from text,
such as names, dates, or events from news articles.

**Chat Bots:** AI-powered programs that simulate human 
conversation, used for customer 
support, information retrieval, or entertainment.

**Text Summarization:** Condensing large amounts of text into 
shorter, coherent summaries, 
often used for news articles or research papers.

**Machine Translation:** Automatically translating text from one language to another.
